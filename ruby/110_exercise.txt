Exercise 110
I. Write a ruby script that will read the file '100_input.txt':
  1. Extract all the numbers from the grid
  2. Sort and print the numbers to the screen

II. Write a ruby script that will read the file '100_input.txt':
  1. Assign addresses to each cell; so top left corner is cell(1,1), bottom right is (5,5)
  2. Consider the content of each cell to be the address of another cell, so 34 is the address
     for cell (3, 4).
  3. Starting from the first cell (1,1), follow the value in the cell to the next one.   
     The value (34) is the coordinate of the next cell row 3, column 4 (having 42).  
  4. Follow the map until you find the treasure where the value of the cell EQUALS its coordinates.

Notes:
  Useful methods on String class
    - split: Splits a string. >>> "a b c".split(' ') => ['a', 'b', 'c']
    - gsub: Substitutes with regex.  >>> "abcd bcde".gsub(/cd/, 'xx') => "abxx bxxe"

  Useful methods on Array class
    - map: converts values to something else.
      Ex: ["a b c", "d e f"].map {|e| e.split(' ') }
      =>  [["a", "b", "c"], ["d", "e", "f"]]
